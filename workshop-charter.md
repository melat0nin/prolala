At the intersection of Law and Computer Science, the craft of building
programs for automating the application of regulations heavily involves
programming language design. Indeed, legal reasoning break traditional
CS abstractions and needs domain-specific tooling for efficient and
precise application development.

The logic programming and knowledge representation communities have
been studying the subject for a long time, yielding significant results that
are directly usable by the programming languages research community to expand
the state of the art in the following areas:

- balancing expressive complexity with semantic simplicity for legal-oriented programming languages;
- building compilers and language tooling to offer a modern development experience;
- proving properties about legal expert systems models or implementations;
- designing industrial-grade frameworks for critical legal expert systems in production.

Moreover, we believe that our mission as the technical representatives of an
interdisciplinary topic is to keep a critical eye on the usages of automated
legal decision systems, and bake in safeguards and limitation within the design
of our tools to comply with the rule of law and the general principles of
legal practice: right to appeal, checks and balances, right to legal
representation, right to privacy, etc.

For these reasons, we run the Programming Languages and the Law (ProLaLa)
whose audience are primarily the people of the Programming Languages (PL)
research community delving in interdisciplinary research with legal scholars.
The submissions to ProLaLa should be technical and concern any aspect of
PL research, in the setting of an application to legal matters. Applied
research is explicitly welcome at ProLaLa, as we believe that real-world
case studies reports bring valuable insights to PL research. Non-PL
scholars are also invited to submit, provided that their research gives some
insights useful to PL research.

The Program Committee (PC) of the ProLaLa workshop should be mainly comprised
of PL researchers, from academia or industry. A few personalities from
transdisciplinary backgrounds like Legal Studies, Philosophy of Law
or Sociology of Law can also be invited to the PC, to assess that the
technical contributions respect the overarching principle of complying with
the rule of law and the general principles of legal practice.
